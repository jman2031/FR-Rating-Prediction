Absence of keyboard light is another point against this laptop inasmuch as almost all new laptops have keyboard light inbuilt.

Great processors, gpu - most games run at ultra settings with 60+ fps. Note - rtx 3060 is the lowest powered gpu in the 30xx series(better go for 2070 for more power)
Heats fast, but good cooling - specially the availability of turbo mode to overclock the fans and cool down quite fast.
Sound is not the best, but given its a gaming laptop, its better than average.
An overall very satisfactory product, as a gamer and programmer, I feel very comfortable with all ...

1282,Good,"Good purchased given that this is a rare combination of RTX-3060 with CPU i7-10870h . However dont expect a mindboggling performance (2 less stars) because the CPU appears to be underperforming. it is almost on par with my 5 year old Dell. Can play most games at 60 FPS (CyberPunk 2077, Forxa Horizon 4 etc.) Turbo cooler is a good feature. I was expectig better. If you have a fe more cash to spare go for ASUS Strix. Now dont get me wrong, i mean for beginner to medium level gamers this laptop ...

HDD is 7200 so not slow at all and loads every game pretty quickly, and it has two slots for M.2 SSDs as well, although we cant upgrade it ourselves due to warranty seal.

2. Screen bleeding ( within a week ).
3. lowest battery life ever in my usage...!!",5
2782,Worth the money,"Only cons I found
1. Major thing is about speaker-even though we purchase a premium laptop the sound quality is very poor not audibible and not at even loud atleast. The budget laptop speakers are far better
2. Battery is draining fast.
3. Heating issue you should always put on a table.
4. There is no type-c charging you can only use for file transfering
5.Attracts the finger prints and oil easily need to have a good maintainance
7. Sometimes the turbo button is not working.
6. Last thing...

On the 7th day, I reached out to them but they didn't want to help, they said base warranty registration has not been done (for which no intimation was received neither any software directed for the same post first boot) and now it will take ...

2785,Really Nice,"It is really a beast. Everything is superfine except its heat dissipation system. In hot weather and hot days it becomes more hot without max fan mode on. Audio system is not upto the mark. Also after updating to Windows 11, its booting time is also increased which is a problem of Windows 11 with SSDs. TBH, my overall work performance is the best with this beast.",4
2786,Wonderful,"This is my first review ever. Value for money product. Good display except for the light screenbleeding issue but the colour accuracy makes up for it .
Rendering in Adobe premier pro is quick without much of a framedrops, 90fps average while playing Forza Horizon 4 in ultra settings. So Gpu is great, thanks to RTX 3060.
I7 10870h gives a decent Cpu performance. There is no overheating as such. Overall a decent package for content creators and game lovers.",5

Except the obvious average battery but that's to be expected from a gaming laptop and almost no audibility from the speakers. The display is good, the keyboard with the rgb is good and it's not too heavy to carry around. The design is simple yet stylish I would say and the performance is good. Also, I learned that you could get a lot of performance improvement from running dual channel ram.. Wish it were dua...

2789,Super!,"Best 3060 laptop of this price range. Only better laptop with a 3060 would be the Lenovo Legion 5, which is consequently also quite a bit more expensive(1L on discount vs 1.3L). 105w TDP is only lower than the aforementioned Legion 5 which has 130w TDP. HDD is 7200 so not slow at all and loads every game pretty quickly, and it has two slots for M.2 SSDs as well, although we cant upgrade it ourselves due to warranty seal.

In terms of actual perfs, the GPU works like a charm and gives 60 FPS ...

The display is also great. The weight of the laptop is not much and is very easy to carry. The speaker sound is not high enough. The turbo mode is enough to cool down your pc when its temperature is high(very rare temp rise).",5

Use Windows 10 or debloat Win11 (ThisIsWin11) to get the most out of the battery.

Compared Lenovo IdeaPad, Hp Pavillion gaming and, MSI GF 63 thin.
I found this to stand out for my usage (academic software, light gaming, and rigid body).
Fans are abruptly silent on regular usage, though the bottom vents aren't as proper as in the case of MSI; you won't notice a difference if you keep the device on a table.

Second you cannot play medium or heavy games like GTA-5 without the help of cooling pad, the laptop heats a lot (which can reduce the life of the laptop)...if you play any game like valorant for longer hours u can feel the ...

Battery is drains so fast that you can't imagine, and trust me those who personally use this laptop can say same, and second worst part about this laptop is it's speakers, seriously your mobile phone can play better sound than this laptop.

1. Laptop performance is good (4.5)

I've heard that this laptop heats up really quickly, but I didn't felt any thing like that. This laptop never reaches more than 10 degrees above my room temperature, even after I game on it for 4 hours. This can run mostly all games on high setting with 60 fps. I personally have tried 2 games on it valorant and apex legends both runs on high setting with 60 fps. And even this gives me 60 fps with high settings while recording in Valor...

3535,Very Good with few caveats,"Great laptop except for a few flaws-Charging port is surprisingly difficult to insert the cable into due to a key like shape-needs to be inserted at a specific angle.

Colour scheme is definitely on the duller side, which is good for indoor folks like me but for people prefering bright colours, this might be a problem.

The cooling fan is quite loud but does its job well.

Other than that, no specific complaints so far. Using it for a month now. On time and secure delivery by Flipkart",4

Good things:
1 . Comparing my old laptop without graphic card and this lap performance is well

Bad things:

1 . Battery backup is extremely 2hrs without game and big application iam using only virtual office like zoom meet it's dried after 2 and half hour very worst

2. Camera quality very very worst like VGA camara

3616,Terrific purchase,Got this one week before. Still got to learn so much about this pc. Very cool looking and stylish. Nice for small games. Graphic card supports many pc games. Xbox game bar is available.,5
3617,Pretty good,"After using 2 days -:

Perfomance - good
Battery - ok
Display -good
Build quality : could ve been better
Heating fastly while playing GTA 5 in high setting

Battery in normal - 3-4 hr
Gaming (gta 5 in very hight set) - 1-2 hr


My opinion about this lap : if you want good gaming with other works go for this. Don't expect battery from this laptop and build quilty is also not that great. Buy this lap when it's price is under 53k ...

The laptop has decent overclocking headroom and the thermals are pretty good with vents at the bottom for intake. A cooling pad will keep it even cooler.",5
3792,Awesome,"Overall very good price to performance ratio.
With upgrades like RAM and a SSD, the laptop would be even better - has extra empty slots for the same.

Definitely Recommended for anyone looking for a value for money laptop.",5

Regular day to day tasks work like charm. A must buy for Students, Office users and occasional gamers",5
3892,Mind-blowing purchase,"And what a lappy! In the beginning I was skeptical about Ryzen processor because I have always used Intel. But I don't regret a bit as this is the best processor for this range.

3895,Pretty good,"First things first, Its the only laptop with such balanced yet powerful configuration.
If you go with thin and light type, it can only be useful in normal uses and not for high end gaming but has great battery like 6+ hrs. And if u consider gaming laptops with H series processors, we can't expect battery above 3-4 hrs even under light usage due to higher TDP. And thats where this laptop shines, you can play almost all games in this, plus when you just want to do normal work , it can lasts u f...

1) Ryzen 5 5500u is way better than the older 3500h and you can actually feel the difference (my friend have 3500h variant).
2) 1660 gfx card under this price segment is a bang for buck. I had no problems playing AAA games with maxed graphics at 50+ fps. Older games like GTA 5, CSGO etc are smoother than ever. Even Minecraft with heavy texture packs runs smoothly.

3970,Just wow!,"Recently I brought this master piece and belive me one of the best laptop under 55k. This laptop built with aprofessional design and very light weight.
So there are some feature which I love the most:
1. The Back-lit : keyword look more professional with the Back-lit and there's enough brightness if you're working on dark.
2.style and weight - so if you're a professional or a student definetly go for it. It's look very simple and a light weight device easy to carry.",5

Your display will get catches from the keyboard when you put anything other than laptop in the backpack coz the lid is so weak. This is very disappointing.

Good battery backup because of U series,
Can handle top games which none does in the price segment,

-Cooling system is good
-Premium look,

3995,Terrific purchase,"To be very honest this is amazing product.
The only con is that build quality is not that good but you can manage. The biggest myth is sound quality which quite loud in this but the 720p camera is very very bad , like bad as my previous laptop which was just 18000 in price .
In a nuty go for it don't think too much beleive me you will proud of your decision.

Csgo runs fine.
Windows is pre installed, home edition.
Webcam is not good but I usually keep that taped up so no worries there.
Display is pretty good
All in all I will call this one the mid range king.",5
3997,Wonderful,"It's good enough for almost anyone, So if you aren't bothered by a slightly bulki looking laptop then it's the best computer for this price range, try getting it with gst bill as you can get this for almost 46k... It's good for any workload but there is a bunch of pre installed apps so delete them when you buy (was not expecting that)",4
3998,Great Product (except webcam),"After two days of usage, laptop is working great. It is snappy and apps open very fast with zero lag.
I got battery backup of 5 hours with browsing and watching content.

Cons: 0.9 MP webcam is below average. Speaker volume is a bit low. I use headphones so I don't mind.
Also note that lifetime MS Office is not provided.

performance:
you can run any AAA titles at 60 fps at very high or even ultra settings.
It runs really hot going to about 90¬∞c (GPU temperature) and 80¬∞c(CPU temperature) after 1hr of gaming.
I would suggest not to install windows 11 (due to obvious bugs in it), wait till all are fixed.
Built:
Aluminum back and plastic frame
uses a new honeycomb design which mostly doesn't affect the temperature of the system

2)near top of keyboard there is a huge heating issue.definately need to buy cooling pad

4851,Terrific purchase,Good quality,5
4852,Great product at a extraordinary price,"An absolute beast for the price.

Other than the
1) battery life
2) body of the laptop getting toasty while gaming
3) noise the fan makes while in turbo mode

can't think of any cons.",5
4853,Worth the money,"It is good product but acer should have to upgrade the cooling system
Only 2 heatsink pipe because of bad cooling system they have underclock the cpu and GPU , you need to have cooling pad",4
4854,Worth every penny,"Super laptop
High processor
I love this laptop ‚ù§Ô∏è",5
4855,Awesome,"Nice product.. we need to talk about cons...!!!

1. Electricity leak over metal body on touchpad area
2. Screen bleeding ( within a week ).
3. lowest battery life ever in my usage...!!",5
4856,Worth the money,"Only cons I found
1. Major thing is about speaker-even though we purchase a premium laptop the sound quality is very poor not audibible and not at even loud atleast. The budget laptop speakers are far better
2. Battery is draining fast.
3. Heating issue you should always put on a table.
4. There is no type-c charging you can only use for file transfering
5.Attracts the finger prints and oil easily need to have a good maintainance
7. Sometimes the turbo button is not working.
6. Last thing...

On the 7th day, I reached out to them but they didn't want to help, they said base warranty registration has not been done (for which no intimation was received neither any software directed for the same post first boot) and now it will take ...

4859,Really Nice,"It is really a beast. Everything is superfine except its heat dissipation system. In hot weather and hot days it becomes more hot without max fan mode on. Audio system is not upto the mark. Also after updating to Windows 11, its booting time is also increased which is a problem of Windows 11 with SSDs. TBH, my overall work performance is the best with this beast.",4
4860,Wonderful,"This is my first review ever. Value for money product. Good display except for the light screenbleeding issue but the colour accuracy makes up for it .
Rendering in Adobe premier pro is quick without much of a framedrops, 90fps average while playing Forza Horizon 4 in ultra settings. So Gpu is great, thanks to RTX 3060.
I7 10870h gives a decent Cpu performance. There is no overheating as such. Overall a decent package for content creators and game lovers.",5

4862,Perfect product!,"It has been 3 weeks since getting this thing but gotta say it's served well so far.. Except the obvious average battery but that's to be expected from a gaming laptop and almost no audibility from the speakers. The display is good, the keyboard with the rgb is good and it's not too heavy to carry around. The design is simple yet stylish I would say and the performance is good. Also, I learned that you could get a lot of performance improvement from running dual channel ram.. Wish it were dua...

4863,Super!,"Best 3060 laptop of this price range. Only better laptop with a 3060 would be the Lenovo Legion 5, which is consequently also quite a bit more expensive(1L on discount vs 1.3L). 105w TDP is only lower than the aforementioned Legion 5 which has 130w TDP. HDD is 7200 so not slow at all and loads every game pretty quickly, and it has two slots for M.2 SSDs as well, although we cant upgrade it ourselves due to warranty seal.

In terms of actual perfs, the GPU works like a charm and gives 60 FPS ...

Had it for a week. Power backup is around 5 hrs @ ""Better battery"" settings. HUGE power brick.",5
4866,Perfect product!,"I got it at 107k around a month ago. I have played multiple games during this time, all of them in high/extreme settings and have not faced any issues. The display is also great. The weight of the laptop is not much and is very easy to carry. The speaker sound is not high enough. The turbo mode is enough to cool down your pc when its temperature is high(very rare temp rise).",5
4867,Just wow!,"If you want to do heavy tasks like video editing, design work, play heavy games... Do consider adding another 8/16 gb ram to make it dual channel... The performance will be significantly better.
There are many detailed reviews in this review section which i also agree with so you can refer to those.

Everything is spot on, be it tracking or anything you ask about..
I recommend you go for 44 mm though. Other variants feel quite small.!!",5
9504,Excellent,"Smartwatch for android users can't get better than this. Use it wisely, you will be able to get 36 hours+ from full charge.

9506,Great product,"Got for 13.5K on offer. It's the best Android smart watch available in the market. Right from screen to ease of use. Battery is okay as per it's size, and goes up to 2-3 days. I got this for notification and navigation while driving and it's doing way too fine with that.",5
9507,Terrific,Many smart watches sold at higher price by keeping music as additional feature but this watch is having awesome features at affordable price . Worthy buy .,5
9508,Excellent,It's a steal deal and worth every penny. I got it for INR 10990 and in this price range there is absolutely nothing great you can ask for. SAMSUNG has done very nice job in build quality and interface just a small issue with glass at the top which is rightly touching the edge and no protection for it. So have to buy a protector for protecting the main screen. Rest all worth all good.,5
9509,Good,"Everything about watch is good except:
1. Battery - max I could get was 2 days with power saver ON
Without power saver and AOD off 1 day at max
2. Raise to wake feature is pathetic, never works properly, very inconsistent.
3. Body mass index is way out of normal, I have proper scale which measures 4 to 5% lower Fat than this watch, I have confirmed accuracy of that scale, so watch is wildly inaccurate.",3

9511,Must buy!,"Think in deep before buying , I will recommend if you belong to samsung ecosystem if not go for Amaze fit pro it gives same features with super battery .
Battery is very poor max to max it will withstand for 1.5 days in single charge .

Rest all wrt to features are just legendary (can't see better features than this at this rate ).",5
9512,Wonderful,"Display is too crisp, dim as well as bright enough. Health trecking features are on par and i guess it eill learn with time. One UI on top of wear os is great fast and ahead of all the wear os devices out there.
Battery should be enough for daily users and some tweets have to be done for optimal performance.
Straps are strong enough, slippery and will surely depreciate after time passes.
Touch bezel is accurate and haptics are great.

9527,Terrific,Love it .....value for money,5
9528,Worthless,"Battery and charging department is the worst by Samsung. Takes so much time to charge and battery even can't stand a day , even if all sensors are turned off. Plus it heats up during wireless charging in summer and stops charging automatically , till temp is down. Watch even lags during heat.
Charging is really very slow and worst experience by Samsung. Overall for fun watch is good.",1
9529,Worthless,Received a malfunctioning watch. It doesn't connect with any mobiles.,1

9536,Wonderful,"There came an issue while I had to update it initially and then I needed to disconnect it from phone as wifi auto-disconnected.

9547,Mind-blowing purchase,Good,5
9548,Hated it!,The tracker is tracking my laptop heart rate and stress level as well as blood oxygen level. Never though samsung would be this much advanced. The flipkart app is not giving a option to upooad a video otherwise would have uploaded. Trusted brand scam! If cant trust samsung then dont know which brand should be trusted.,1

9570,Worth every penny,Excellent product much better than Apple Watch,5
9571,Bad quality,Better than apple watch,2
9572,Don't waste your money,"While the watch is connected to the phone and bluetooth headset, when we receive a call it is directing to the watch loudspeaker audio and not transfering to the Bluetooth head set. This is the product issues and there is no solution for this yet from the Samsung.
Before purchasing the watch please keep the drawback in mind and go for the purchase. Rest of the options works fine as mentioned over the specifications, but the actual option call receiving from the watch to the Bluetooth headset ...

9593,Great product,"One of finest Smart watches I've used till date.
Everything is spot on, be it tracking or anything you ask about..
I recommend you go for 44 mm though. Other variants feel quite small.!!",5
9594,Excellent,"Smartwatch for android users can't get better than this. Use it wisely, you will be able to get 36 hours+ from full charge.

Gives range of smart features, tracks your activities, gives you directions on your watch screen when running maps in your phoneüëå, maps your walking/cycling well, hello it has play store.

Forget about battery capacity, its a useful beast.",5

9597,Terrific,Many smart watches sold at higher price by keeping music as additional feature but this watch is having awesome features at affordable price . Worthy buy .,5
9598,Excellent,It's a steal deal and worth every penny. I got it for INR 10990 and in this price range there is absolutely nothing great you can ask for. SAMSUNG has done very nice job in build quality and interface just a small issue with glass at the top which is rightly touching the edge and no protection for it. So have to buy a protector for protecting the main screen. Rest all worth all good.,5
9599,Good,"Everything about watch is good except:
1. Battery - max I could get was 2 days with power saver ON
Without power saver and AOD off 1 day at max
2. Raise to wake feature is pathetic, never works properly, very inconsistent.
3. Body mass index is way out of normal, I have proper scale which measures 4 to 5% lower Fat than this watch, I have confirmed accuracy of that scale, so watch is wildly inaccurate.",3
9600,Mind-blowing purchase,"Superb design,features and looks in a single word i just wanna say wow. Thanks to flipkart for fast delivery and you guys go for it... absolutely awesome watch i have ever seen.",5
9601,Must buy!,"Think in deep before buying , I will recommend if you belong to samsung ecosystem if not go for Amaze fit pro it gives same features with super battery .
Battery is very poor max to max it will withstand for 1.5 days in single charge .

Rest all wrt to features are just legendary (can't see better features than this at this rate ).",5
9602,Wonderful,"Display is too crisp, dim as well as bright enough. Health trecking features are on par and i guess it eill learn with time. One UI on top of wear os is great fast and ahead of all the wear os devices out there.
Battery should be enough for daily users and some tweets have to be done for optimal performance.
Straps are strong enough, slippery and will surely depreciate after time passes.
Touch bezel is accurate and haptics are great.
I personally don't know why the Indian government doesn't a...

Even mi band has gps at least in its application.
But the dizo watch application doesn't have any option like that.

Absolutely gorgeous looking watch, does look like an apple watch (without the crown) and it is premium.

Rest of it is satisfactory only and like other smart watch/bands.

As the watch has no features to distinguish from other brands I'll only be providing the cons here for you to decide.

1. The heart rate and spo2 sensor is mostly inaccurate, it even takes readings of my bed (when the bed sheet is blue only).
2. Lesser watch faces provided.

I regularly track my workouts at gym and I am happy to say that the sensors are very accurate and counts reps, hand movements very accurately.

Battery life you can expect easy 1.5 to 2 day with casual use
You can play some good mini games

10582,Decent product,"While it is an excellent purchase, i am still growing into its features. I am using a non Samsung phone so I had to download a couple of apps to get the features working. The watch module is robust though it needs a protective case to retain its sheen. The UI is intuitive and slick with minimal stutters. The Fitness measuring parameters are industry standard. The biggest issue is the battery life which lasts 1.5 days even with minimal usage.

Absolutely gorgeous looking watch, does look like an apple watch (without the crown) and it is premium.

Rest of it is satisfactory only and like other smart watch/bands.

As the watch has no features to distinguish from other brands I'll only be providing the cons here for you to decide.

1. The heart rate and spo2 sensor is mostly inaccurate, it even takes readings of my bed (when the bed sheet is blue only).
2. Lesser watch faces provided.

Even mi band has gps at least in its application.
But the dizo watch application doesn't have any option like that.

11938,Good,"Go for the watch if you want the looks only.

Absolutely gorgeous looking watch, does look like an apple watch (without the crown) and it is premium.

Rest of it is satisfactory only and like other smart watch/bands.

As the watch has no features to distinguish from other brands I'll only be providing the cons here for you to decide.

1. The heart rate and spo2 sensor is mostly inaccurate, it even takes readings of my bed (when the bed sheet is blue only).
2. Lesser watch faces provided.

#It worth its cost.
#I like the wallpapers.
#Metallic built give it a premium look.

12050,Delightful,"The watch is fantastic. The only thing is.. when you walk or cycle it will just show you the stats but no gps.
Even mi band has gps at least in its application.
But the dizo watch application doesn't have any option like that.
Further the activity modes are different but the way it tracks a certain activity is same. For cycling for walking for running.. it shows the same UI
The music controls doesn't show the title of the music playing. It just has the basic music controls.

12058,Good,"Go for the watch if you want the looks only.

Absolutely gorgeous looking watch, does look like an apple watch (without the crown) and it is premium.

Rest of it is satisfactory only and like other smart watch/bands.

As the watch has no features to distinguish from other brands I'll only be providing the cons here for you to decide.

1. The heart rate and spo2 sensor is mostly inaccurate, it even takes readings of my bed (when the bed sheet is blue only).
2. Lesser watch faces provided.

Nothing is good but only for show off you can buy this product... Look is ok",2
12060,Horrible,"Not worth for money, it behaves like a roadside product. Not even water resistance as mentioned. Bought on Nov 2021 and in a month of time it is replaced for improper touch function. later it started rusting on the golden finish. As it is cosmetic it will not b covered under warranty. So now it's useless. But the marketing is based on the look and finish also. Looks great to get cheated like this",1

In built GPS takes about 6 secs to lock in and then it is super accurate to use. I have stopped carrying my phone during morning/evening walks. Shifted songs on the watch. Battery lasts about 1.5 to 2 days easily with my current settings... (Havi...

12500,Perfect product!,"Really a great watch
Battery life you can expect easy 1.5 to 2 day with casual use
You can play some good mini games
Sleep tracking is accurate
Probably the best wear os watch at the price range rn",5
12501,Decent product,"While it is an excellent purchase, i am still growing into its features. I am using a non Samsung phone so I had to download a couple of apps to get the features working. The watch module is robust though it needs a protective case to retain its sheen. The UI is intuitive and slick with minimal stutters. The Fitness measuring parameters are industry standard. The biggest issue is the battery life which lasts 1.5 days even with minimal usage.

Pros:
>Design
>Build Quality
>Wear OS 3.2

12502,Great product,"One of finest Smart watches I've used till date.
Everything is spot on, be it tracking or anything you ask about..
I recommend you go for 44 mm though. Other variants feel quite small.!!",5
12503,Excellent,"Smartwatch for android users can't get better than this. Use it wisely, you will be able to get 36 hours+ from full charge.

Gives range of smart features, tracks your activities, gives you directions on your watch screen when running maps in your phoneüëå, maps your walking/cycling well, hello it has play store.

Forget about battery capacity, its a useful beast.",5
12504,Just wow!,"Best offer of the year bought it for 13k. Best Android smart watch, battery backup is superb, Best display super bright, my phone is Samsung goes well with it so setup was fast, no lags as of now, no cons until now. Great delivery by flipkart delivered in 2 days as mentioned.",5
12505,Great product,"Got for 13.5K on offer. It's the best Android smart watch available in the market. Right from screen to ease of use. Battery is okay as per it's size, and goes up to 2-3 days. I got this for notification and navigation while driving and it's doing way too fine with that.",5
12506,Terrific,Many smart watches sold at higher price by keeping music as additional feature but this watch is having awesome features at affordable price . Worthy buy .,5
12507,Excellent,It's a steal deal and worth every penny. I got it for INR 10990 and in this price range there is absolutely nothing great you can ask for. SAMSUNG has done very nice job in build quality and interface just a small issue with glass at the top which is rightly touching the edge and no protection for it. So have to buy a protector for protecting the main screen. Rest all worth all good.,5
12508,Good,"Everything about watch is good except:
1. Battery - max I could get was 2 days with power saver ON
Without power saver and AOD off 1 day at max
2. Raise to wake feature is pathetic, never works properly, very inconsistent.
3. Body mass index is way out of normal, I have proper scale which measures 4 to 5% lower Fat than this watch, I have confirmed accuracy of that scale, so watch is wildly inaccurate.",3

One downside is the battery life which is not great but okay. Though, you can stretch it to more than a day on a moderate use and limited functionality.

And also I feel the dial is small.. Only thing is it has less sports mode.. Even if u have 60+ sports mode in other watches.. U won't use all off it. My suggestion is if u want fitness tracker..

1. Light weight
2. Different attractive watch faces

1. Easy scratches on display
2. Poor battery life in heavy use & ""always on"" display feature
3. Small dial/display size
4. Poor quality charging cable
5. Bad tracking experience. If I walk 3km it shows 9km. If I walk 3k steps it shows 23k steps!

Cons:
This is a fitness watch. Hence I would expect it to be more better in terms of sensors but to my surprise the steps count sensor is complete disaster. I have AQFT w15 watch too when I travel from home to office for 15kms it measures step count as max 200. This noise watch measured 2679. Means it‚Äôs too sensitive and ...

13334,Fabulous!,"I got this smartwatch during first day of the sale and was delivered within one day so thanks to flipkart. I am quite impressed with the build & design as the watch is very lightweight. Actually, the amoled screen got my attention which is rare to see at this price range and it's absolutely great. UI is also smooth and snappy but don't expect it to be equal with the watches that has ""Wear OS"".

13335,Good product but needs work.,"I'm writing a review after 4 days. Initial impressions are that this watch is excellent. The display is just amazing and the always on feature is really helpful as I use it the most. I gets really bright and is clearly legible in direct sunlight. The watch strap is very comfortable, however you need 20mm straps for this and not 22mm as Noise recommends. The heart rate sensor is fairly accurate, however the SPO2 sensor measures the oxygen saturation of a fruit as my image shows.

Really good Stuff!!,5

13338,Does the job,"Pros:
* The AMOLED display is hands down the best part of the watch.
* 42mm fits nicely especially if you have small wrists. The strap is comfortable. Decent build quality
*Good touch response & UI

Cons:
*Fair to say that the step counting feature is a joke. Had a OnePlus band before this & that was much more accurate. So, if fitness is important, stay away.
* With Always-on display feature turned on, battery needs to be recharged at the end of the day. 7 day battery life is a pipe dream

Cons:

(2) whenever I keep my watch on table the heart rate sensor is turning on automatic. Hence draining battery.

(3) if you use the always on display it will consume like 30-40% battery in 3-4 hours.

1. Good Design
2. Amazing screen quality
3. Best in class watch faces.
4. Raise to wake function is just ok.
5. Always on display is beautiful

Cons:
This is a fitness watch. Hence I would expect it to be more better in terms of sensors but to my surprise the steps count sensor is complete disaster. I have AQFT w15 watch too when I travel from home to office for 15kms it measures step count as max 200. This noise watch measured 2679. Means it‚Äôs too sensitive and ...

13934,Fabulous!,"I got this smartwatch during first day of the sale and was delivered within one day so thanks to flipkart. I am quite impressed with the build & design as the watch is very lightweight. Actually, the amoled screen got my attention which is rare to see at this price range and it's absolutely great. UI is also smooth and snappy but don't expect it to be equal with the watches that has ""Wear OS"". Performance wise, it shows all the notifications, can mute calls, has quick reply functionality whic...

13935,Good product but needs work.,"I'm writing a review after 4 days. Initial impressions are that this watch is excellent. The display is just amazing and the always on feature is really helpful as I use it the most. I gets really bright and is clearly legible in direct sunlight. The watch strap is very comfortable, however you need 20mm straps for this and not 22mm as Noise recommends. The heart rate sensor is fairly accurate, however the SPO2 sensor measures the oxygen saturation of a fruit as my image shows.

Really good Stuff!!,5
13937,Great product,"It's was awesome üëå worth for money, with the new update customizable wallpaper also we can set, display quality was so good, battery üîã pickup also fine. Only call option is missing other than that this was watch is so cool üòé.",5
13938,Does the job,"Pros:
* The AMOLED display is hands down the best part of the watch.
* 42mm fits nicely especially if you have small wrists. The strap is comfortable. Decent build quality
*Good touch response & UI

Cons:
*Fair to say that the step counting feature is a joke. Had a OnePlus band before this & that was much more accurate. So, if fitness is important, stay away.
* With Always-on display feature turned on, battery needs to be recharged at the end of the day. 7 day battery life is a pipe dream

Battery life is good(charged it on 14th evening and currently it is on 50%(AOD off))

Heart rate, Spo2 monitor, and sport mode are also accurate.

It is a good and stylish watch along with good features in this price range.",4
13940,Just an average fitness watch,"It's not a smartwatch but a fitness watch which lacks accuracy for most of the health parameters.

3. Build quality of watch is good. Watch strap is also of decent make.
4. Noisefit app is a decent application bringing you the entire data at one place.

Pros:
(1) Nice display.


Cons:

(1) Step counter is not working properly. If you travel somewhere on a vehicle it will increase the step count.

(2) whenever I keep my watch on table the heart rate sensor is turning on automatic. Hence draining battery.

(3) if you use the always on display it will consume like 30-40% battery in 3-4 hours.

It also has BP and Oxegen monitor as well which can be handily not for accurate use.

For 2.5k it is ok but don't spend much on these watches if you are looking for some serious lifestyle. Just use it for casual fitness tracker for basics.

Overall its a good device in this ...

I think the battery last up to hardly 3 days. Except this the watch is very nice in this price range.,3

17181,Does the job,"This comes with a 16a plug which won't fit in most of our normal sockets. It requires international 16a sockets. Considering the actual power consumption of the monitor, this is absolute overkill. Why does it comes with a 16a plug? To make our lives miserable? Maybe because this piece was never designed for Indian/international consumers. Which is still mediocre.

17549,Great monitor the price.,"This is my first ever 1080p IPS monitor. The display is really nice and the colors are all really vibrant. It supports freesync and upto 75Hz refresh rate. Out of the box it's at 60Hz unless you turn on freesync. You can unlock the 75Hz even on Nvidia graphics cards, except it won't support the AMD freesync technology.

17585,Wonderful,Overall a very good monitor. Just that it comes without a VGA cable you get only a HDMI cable with the power cable in the box. In case you are changing from a CRT monitor to a LCD you might need to purchase a VGA to VGA cable separately.(It should have come in the box seriously). IPS panel is the right opinion plus you can go all the way to 75htz quiet a good option for gamers on a budget.,4

20431,Good monitor!,"Really good monitor. I like the auto setting for brightness, called as eye care. It works well for me. The monitor briefly flickered two times, but I guess that could be due to cable being little loose in the laptop's end. I am not touching it anymore and it works fine. 24"" display is perfect, not too big or small. I use it for coding or when I need to open a large spredsheet, sometimes watch movies as well.

20434,Brilliant,I bought it for my PC and PS3. First of all Picture quality and viewing angles are great. The bright intelligence is such a nice feature especially at this price range. You can use it with lights on or off without having to adjust the brightness constantly. Been using it for a week and I haven't had any dead pixels yet. There is a slight light bleeding In the bottom 2 corners which is very common for ips panel displays. Highly recommended for movie streaming or console gaming.,5

The platform which I work on, the websites looks perfect and I do not have to squint my eyes like I used to do in my 14"" laptop provided by my office. Sure there is pixel bleeding from the edges, and pixels can be separated if you look very closely, but who will go that close to a monitor.

It's the same panel if I'm not wrong, without the Brightness sensor. Which I found not to be of too much use. I always found it to be a bit too bright in the day, so I ended up tweaking the brightness myself. Save 1k and get the 2475h instead.

Panel is good. Colors are good. Eye strain is low. Stand is sturdy. Monitor looks good.

21420,Best gaming monitor,"Awesome experience while gaming, 60hz to 165hz is a massive change. Mainly bought this for gaming and graphics.

My POV: 10A power plug is enough, 16A plug not required. Colors, contrast needs to be calibrated. A very negligible light bleeding issue in the top-left corner. Only 120hz with HDMI cable.

Everything else is perfect. And thanks to Flipkart for the quick delivery.",5

21425,Does the job,Monitor is good but if you consider this for speaker please do not go for it. This one has worst built in speakers in it. You will have to use an external speaker.,3
21426,Just okay,"First time when i received the monitor it had 10 to 12 black spots or dead pixels.

Flipkart helped me to replace the monitor with new one. But upon checking, again, i found multiple dead spots on screen.
But, as second time the number of dead pixels were less, i accepted it.

But is disappointing to see dead pixels on your new screen. Especially, when you choose brand like LG.",3
